# minima
minima_n7_opt:
find minimum of nonlinear multivatiable function for n =7, with
1. nonlinear inequality contraint
2. nonlinear equality contraint

minima_n7_bound:
find minimum of nonlinear multivatiable function for n =7, with
	nonlinear inequality contraint + (1-3) variables  on the boundary -pi or pi
	--> larger than minima_n7_opt 	

minima_n5_opt:
find minimum of nonlinear multivatiable function for n =7, with
1. nonlinear inequality contraint
2. nonlinear equality contraint 
	--> results have been included in the inequality constraint case

minima_n5_figure:
	plot contour map for n=5
